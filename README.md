# LabviewPipelineSampleProject
This repo contains the powershell scripts, VIs and azure YML file for a fully funcitonal pipeline on Azure DevOps.

## TL:DR
This is an overview how this repo should help you along:

![workflow](Documentation/overview.png)

- Grab an old laptop / VM
- Install LabVIEW on it
- Install the Azure DevOps agent / GitLab Runner / GitHub Runner / etcâ€¦ on it
- Head to this repo and download the code 
- Apply the VIPC file (for Caraya and G-CLI)
- (If not using Azure DevOps, throw the azure-pieline.yml into ChatGPT and convert it to instructions readable for your platform)
- Adapt some variables according to the instructions in the readme.md and install a VIPC with Caraya and G-Cli
- Run the powershell scripts on your machine for each step
- Push all of it to your repo
- Watch your first full pipeline run

## Pitfals
Things to watch out for while working on your Azure DevOps project:

- Access to pipeline runner is a must
- Agree on a project template (disk folder structure and LabVIEW project)
- Start small
- Use semantic versioning for commits (e.g. `0.9.1`)
- Take care of failing pipelines, broken pipelines are a sign to your team that it's okay to push code that is not good enough.

## Detailed Instructions


This example works best when you are coming from an empty Azure DevOps repo.

1. Create a new repo in your Azure project and clone it to your pc

2. Download the code from this repo and unzip into the newly created Azure Repo

![DownloadCode](Documentation/downloadRepo.png)

3. Open VIPM and install the following packages on your machine and on your agent/runner:
    - [Caraya](https://www.vipm.io/package/jki_lib_caraya/)
    - [G CLI](https://www.vipm.io/package/wiresmith_technology_lib_g_cli/)
    - [VIA Checkstyle](Source/LabVIEW/CICD/VIs/ni_lib_via_checkstyle-1.0.1.4.vip)
    - [DQMH](https://www.vipm.io/package/delacor_lib_dqmh_toolkit/)

4. Open the LabVIEW project at `root\Source\LabVIEW\pipelineExampleProject.lvproj`. It should open without any errors or dependencies missing.

5. Connect the agent to your azure instance, [the instructions can be found here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/windows-agent?view=azure-devops). I would strongly recommend to use an interactive agent, not a service. This will enable to see all ativity that happens on your agent.

6. Open a powershell console at the location of `root\Source\LabVIEW\CICD`. Open the scripts and inspect them one by one for their functionality. Run: 

```powershell
.\openProject.ps1
```
This will open the project for you. If you had it already open, close the project and try again.

7. Run the unit tests:

```powershell
.\.\runUnitTests.ps1
```
THis will create a unit test results file.

9. Run the VI Analyzer for your code.
